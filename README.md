CorpWatch API Data Bundle
=========================

This Symfony2 bundle models the entities created for the [CorpWatch API][1].

> The CorpWatch API uses automated parsers to extract the subsidiary relationship
> information from [Exhibit 21 of companies' 10-K filings with the SEC][2] and provides a
> free, well-structured interface for programs to query and process the data.

affiliated with them, but it is [open source][4].
